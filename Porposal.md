# DocApp

> Docs-App is an application that will be use to collect patients information at the time of scheduling the first appointment with a new physician. The application will provide patients with online fillable and submittable forms that will be placed into a database for access by staff members at the doctor's office. This app will assist patients by allowing them to turn in all required forms before a doctor's visit, saving time and the need to print and fax forms, or having to fill out the forms at the doctor's office before consultation. It will also allow office staff to acquire all insurance apporvals prior to patient's arrival to the office, saving additional time. The app will also serve as an iformation and reference portal for patients where they may receive further instructions, changes in scheduling, and directions to the doctor's office.

> For further development, this app may also include a video portal where a doctor may offer virtual consultation. Also a payment section for patients to pay their fees.
